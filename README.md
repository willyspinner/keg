# Welcome
Welcome to the Keg project. This is a web app currently localhosted that allows you to create an associative mind map of connections in your learning. 

Some use cases that this tool can help you with:
- Creating a mind map for essay plans, using the graphs and edges to imply causality between events
- Creating a knowledge graph for research paper's your reading about in a particular field, where the node can be a concept / method / model, and the edges are the relationships between the papers (e.g. citing, supersedence, inspiration, etc.)


# Tasks

## On the roadmap
- Fork `react-digraph` to create a version where you can delete nodes and edges using shift+delete.
- Add pdf reader to view papers 
## Sprint backlog

### TODO
- create edge/node explorer (shows cards of adjacent nodes by edge predicate) - when clicked on, you can explore in graph.

### Doing
- Make mindmap of QA systems and make this the default sample project


### Done
-  use antd design
-  add an accompanying section to the right of the graph that shows selected node's contents in detail.
-  When creating a new node, add an option to create more attributes if needed.
-  make accompanying section editable
-  add multiple projects support
- make edges customizable and configurable.
- create feature to delete and add attributes from accompanying section
